//    It can be shown that when the algorithm has finished executing, each item in S has equal probability (i.e. k/length(S)) of being chosen for the reservoir.
//
//    To see this, consider the following proof by [induction].
//
//    After the (i-1) th round, let us assume, the probability of a number being in the reservoir array is k/(i-1).
//    Since the probability of the number being replaced in the ith round is 1/i, the probability that it survives the ith round is (i-1)/i.
//            Thus, the probability that a given number is in the reservoir after the ith round is the product of these two probabilities,
//    i.e. the probability of being in the reservoir after the (i-1)th round, and surviving replacement in the ith round.
//    This is (k/(i-1)) * ((i-1)/i)=k/i. Hence, the result holds for i, and is therefore true by induction.
//    k/i,(i+1-k)/ (i+1)
