     * Define amazing number as: its value is less than or equal to its index. Given a circular array, find the starting position,
     * such that the total number of amazing numbers in the array is maximized.
     * Example 1: 0, 1, 2, 3
     * Output: 0.    When starting point at position 0, all the elements in the array are equal to its index.
     * So all the numbers are amazing number.
     * Example 2: 1, 0 , 0
     * Output: 1.    When starting point at position 1, the array becomes 0, 0, 1. All the elements are amazing number.
     * If there are multiple positions, return the smallest one.
